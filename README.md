# pptxMaker

Hello! This is my first coding project, called pptxMaker: Praise the Lord. I'm making it so that the people in church can easily make powerpoints for Mass sessions (median age is pushing 70) and to get better at Python and OOP. I have an idea for the basic functionality and am somewhat aware of good coding principles but what better way to expand upon these than by also helping communities. Enjoy :)
